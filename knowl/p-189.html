<p>As is the running theme with elliptic curves, the DSA is easily implemented with elliptic curves in place of the finite field \(\F_p\text{.}\) The advantage is that the ONLY way currently known to attack the discrete log problem in robust elliptic curves is with exponential routines. The Digital Signature Algorithm with elliptic curves is called ECDSA and is in common usage. One of the more surprising applications is in the realm of cryptocurrecy, to be discussed in a sequel section.</p>
