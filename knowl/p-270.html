<p>Suppose that \(z = f(x,y)\) is a function of two independent variables. Just as in one variable, we want to understand how the graph of \(f\) changes at a point, but now we have lots of different directions to look at. To compute the rate of change in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, we can use the <dfn class="terminology">partial derivative</dfn> in those directions. When we take a partial derivative with respect to a variable, we treat all other variables as constant so that we're isolating our view to change in that specific direction.</p>
