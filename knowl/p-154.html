<p>The giant leap that we need to make is this - not every vector space is finite dimensional. An infinite dimensional inner product space is called a <dfn class="terminology">Hilbert space</dfn> (whereas a finite dimensional inner product space is called a <dfn class="terminology">Euclidean space</dfn>). For a Hilbert space, a basis will also be infinite dimensional. (If you're curious, the analogue of a matrix in the Hilbert space setting is called a <dfn class="terminology">linear operator</dfn>, and the general study of these objects is called operator theory.) One of single most important ideas in engineering and modern science is that the set of \(L^2\) functions that are \(2\pi\)-periodic is a Hilbert space. In the next sections, we'll find a truly excellent orthonormal basis for that space of functions, and we'll begin to interpret the coefficients that we compute for a given function in terms of that basis. (This is the launching point of a field called signal analysis, typically found in electrical engineering.)</p>
