<p>Following the abstract version of the rho method, we'll need two “lists” (remember, we're only storing one element at a time) to keep track of \(x_i\) and \(x_{2i}\) to find a collision. But we also need to keep track of what operations \(f\) has performed as we walk up the rho to find the collision. Since we can't predict what \(f\) will do, we will need counters that keep track of how many copies of \(g\) and \(h\) have been multiplied in by \(f\text{.}\) Note that because we're in \(\F_p\text{,}\) we need only to keep track of these exponents modulo \(p-1\) by Fermat's little theorem.</p>
