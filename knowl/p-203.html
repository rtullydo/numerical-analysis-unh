<p>We're left with the following idea: If we suspect that a number \(n\) is prime, check lots of numbers \(a\) as potential witnesses of the compositeness of \(n\text{.}\) If we don't find any witnesses, perhaps we could conclude that \(n\) is prime. The issue with this approach is the existence of a set of numbers called <em class="emphasis">Carmichael numbers</em>, which have the property of possessing <em class="emphasis">no</em> Fermat witnesses. As an example, \(n = 531 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17\) has the property that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a^{531} = a \bmod 531
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>for <em class="emphasis">every</em> integer \(a\text{,}\) and thus has no witnesses to the fact that it is composite. There are infintely many Carmichael numbers, and so it behooves us to develop a test so that every composite \(n\) has lots of witnesses.</p>
