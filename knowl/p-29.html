<p>We're going to start with a straightforward equation to illustrate our first method. Let's find solutions to the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x^2 - 2 = 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now obviously, the answers are \(\pm \sqrt{2}\text{,}\) but how much good is that for computation or application? Where do the values for \(\sqrt{2}\) even come from? (Hint: \(\sqrt{2}\) is defined to be the solution to this equation). <div class="sagecell-octave" id="sage-10"><script type="text/x-sage">X = -3:.1:3;
Y = X.^2 - 2;
plot(X, Y)
set(gca, "xaxislocation","origin")
set(gca, "yaxislocation", "origin")
</script></div> It's clear from the plot generated by the code above that the solutions to \(x^2 - 2 = 0\) are the \(x\)-intercepts of the function \(f(x) = x^2 - 2\text{.}\) If you were asked to guess what the roots were you might say “between -2 and -1 and also between 1 and 2”. That observation is the first step in a set of methods called <dfn class="terminology">bracketing</dfn>. At this point, we can take advantage of one of the core theorems of calculus: the Intermediate Value Theorem.</p>
