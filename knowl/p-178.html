<p>In order for Elgamal signatures to be cryptographically secure, the prime \(p \approx 2^{4000}\) because of the existence of subexponential algorithms like the index calculus that can be used to attack the discrete log problem in \(\F_p\text{.}\) There are two possible approaches to take to make this a more usable system. The first is to choose a huge prime \(p\) to keep the problems large enough to be unsolvable, but work within a special subset of \(\F_p\) called a cyclic subgroup, discussed in the next section. The other approach is to replace \(\F_p\) with a group that isn't attackable by the index calculus, like an elliptic curve \(E(\F_p)\text{,}\) which will be discussed later in the chapter.</p>
