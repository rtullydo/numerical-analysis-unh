<p>One of the most important areas where non-deterministic methods are used in cryptography is in the area of producing and testing numbers that are highly likely to be prime - that is, it is quite expensive to determine with absolute certainty that a number \(n\) is prime, but it can be checked to any amount of desired likelihood. (Such primes are sometimes referred to as <dfn class="terminology">industrial-grade primes</dfn> - that is, good enough for application.) The idea is that even if the tests miss an occasional number that isn't prime, it happens so infrequently that the economic cost of looking for one is prohibitive.</p>
