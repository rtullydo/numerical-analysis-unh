<span class="type">Remark</span> <span class="codenumber">3.2.2</span>.</h6>While we stated the discrete log problem for a generator \(g\text{,}\) (which has order \(p-1\)), we'll in practice need to use elements in \(\F_p\) with large prime order to avoid a clever attack called the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm, to be discussed later. The main point of the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm is that \(p-1\) is always composite when \(p\) is a large prime, and potentially can have lots of small factors (say a pile of \(2\)'s, for example). Thus, choosing an element with large prime order is necessary (though again, this makes the size of the spaces involved that much larger to compensate).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-discretelog.html#remark-1">in-context</a></span>
