<p>The language that we are going to use is called Octave. Octave is an open-source (that is, free) language designed to be compatible with Matlab (which is an industry standard tool, but alas, not free. Matlab is installed on lab computers all over campus and on classroom computers. All code should work in both languages). Octave is available on Mac, PC, and Linux based computers. You should download and install it (or pay for a student license for Matlab, which is $50) as soon as possible.</p>
