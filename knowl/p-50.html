<p>Let's consider a family of functions called the <dfn class="terminology">topologist's sine curves</dfn>. Here is the first member of the family.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f(x) \amp= \sin \frac{1}{x} \amp\text{ if } x \amp\neq 0 \\
\amp = 0 \amp\text{ if } x \amp= 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Notably, this function does not have a limit as \(x \to 0\) from the left or the right. We can try to fill the singularity in the function with the point \((0,0)\text{,}\) but that doesn't make the function continuous. The reason why should be clear from the graph below: as the function approaches \(x = 0\) it oscillates increasingly quickly, essentially filling the area on the \(y\)-axis between -1 and 1. Since the function has a value of 0 at 0, but no limit, \(f\) is discontinuous there.</p>
