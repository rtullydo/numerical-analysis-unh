<p>So far, we have \(4n\) parameters and \(2n + n - 1 + n - 1 = 4n -2\) conditions. Where are the last two conditions going to come from? The endpoints! Since we have two available conditions to impose, we'll get a nice square system if we impose them on the endpoints. There are a couple of common choices for how to do this. The first is called a <dfn class="terminology">natural spline</dfn>, which is the case where the function has no curvature at the endpoints - that is, it's locally linear:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f''(x_1) = f''(x_{n+1}) = 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In some physical applications, the designer of the spline might want to have prescribed slopes at the endpoints instead. That is,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f'(x_1) = c_1, \hspace{.5in} f'(x_{n+1}) = c_2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
