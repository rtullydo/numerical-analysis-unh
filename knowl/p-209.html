<p>The situation is slighly complicated by the fact that the probabilities are what as known as <em class="emphasis">conditional</em>: that is, when \(n\) is composite, 25% of numbers fail to be witnesses, but when \(n\) is prime, 100% of numbers fail to be witnesses. Nevertheless, the basic intuition should be something like “If \(n\) is composite, then the probability that 10 numbers fail to be Miller-Rabin witnesses for \(n\) is \(.25^{10} \approx 10^{-6}\)”. That is, getting 10 or 100 or 1000 failed witnesses makes it exceedingly unlikely that \(n\) is composite. The exact calculation of the probability will have to wait until we have looked more closely at conditional probability.</p>
