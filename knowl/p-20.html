<p>An obvious question should occur to you: why do we care about Taylor series and polynomials? The short answer is that Taylor polynomials behave much like their parent functions “near” the point of expansion.  By including more terms, we typically expect to get a better approximation of the original function and a larger interval on which the approximation is well-behaved. A classical example of this phenomenon can be seen in the Taylor polynomials for \(\sin x\) near \(x_0 = 0\text{.}\)</p>
