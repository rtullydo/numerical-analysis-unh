<p>A detective is called to the scene of a crime where a dead body has just been found.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>She arrives on the scene at 10:23 pm and begins her investigation. Immediately, the temperature of the body is taken and is found to be \(80^{\circ}\)F. The detective checks the programmable thermostat and finds that the room has been kept at a constant \(68^{\circ}\)F for the past 3 days.</li>
<li>After evidence from the crime scene is collected, the temperature of the body is taken once more and found to be \(78.5^{\circ}\) F. This last temperature reading was taken exactly one hour after the first one.</li>
<li>The next day the detective is asked by another investigator, “What time did our victim die?” Assuming that the victim's body temperature was normal (\(98.6^{\circ}\)) prior to death, what is her answer to this question? Newton's Law of Cooling can be used to determine a victim's time of death.</li>
