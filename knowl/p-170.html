<p>Another important piece of working with complex numbers (a formula that physicist Richard Feynman called "the most remarkable theorem in mathematics") is <dfn class="terminology">Euler's formula</dfn>, which allows the expression of movement around the unit circle in terms of a complex exponential function.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\cos \theta + i \sin \theta = e^{i \theta}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>If you're interested in seeing why this might be true, consider the power series expansions for each of the functions in question to at least get a formal sense of the computation. (There isn't any prima facie reason to believe that complex numbers can just be plugged into infinite series, but it turns out to work very similarly to the real case.)</p>
