<p>One of the extremely useful features of the DFT is how good it is at pulling signal out of noise. Consider the following example. We're going to construct a signal with units inherited from a known sample rate. Suppose we have a signal that we sample at a rate of \(Fs\) Hz. Then each increase in array position corresponds to a time step of \(\Delta t = 1/Fs\) seconds. Given a signal of length \(L\text{,}\) the total time of the signal will be \(T = L\times\Delta t\text{.}\) Knowing the sample rate will allow us to explicitly interpret the spectral analysis in terms of the input signal frequencies. (That is, we'll be able to attach units to our spectrum.)</p>
