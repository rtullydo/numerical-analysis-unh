<p>Finally, I'll point out that there are deterministic methods for checking that a number is prime that run in polynomial time <em class="emphasis">but</em> these algorithms require that we assume the truth of perhaps the most famous and important unsolved problems in mathematics, the <dfn class="terminology">Riemann hypothesis</dfn>, which concerns the distribution of prime numbers in the real line. More than 150 years of work has gone into proving or disproving the hypothesis, which to the present has resisted giving up its secrets.</p>
