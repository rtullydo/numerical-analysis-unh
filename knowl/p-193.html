<p>Counting is important because it underlies our intuitive understanding of what probability is: the likelihood of an event is the ratio of the number of ways that even can happen to the total number of possible results in an experiement. The probability of a flipped coin landing on heads is 1/2 because there is one way that a coin can land heads up out of two possible outcomes to a flip. The probability of drawing a face card (J, Q, K) from a deck of a card is 12/52 because there are 12 face cards and 52 total cards that could be drawn. Thus, counting the number of events and the total number of possible outcomes is necessary to develop a theory of probability.</p>
