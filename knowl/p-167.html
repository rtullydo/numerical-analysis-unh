<p>We've at least hinted at the appeal of elliptic curves: storage required for security is growing as computers continue to increase in speed. With that in mind, we point out another place where elliptic curves can be made more efficient. The point \(A\) that Alice sends Bob has two coordinates, but she really only needs to send Bob the \(x\)-coordinate, since Bob can compute the value of \(y^2\) from the knowledge of the elliptic curve \(E\text{.}\) A complication arises where Bob might compute the wrong square root of \(y^2\text{,}\) but in that case he can flip the sign on the \(y\)-coordinate to get the inverse. Of course, this leaves open the important question of <em class="emphasis">how</em> Bob can compute square roots in \(E(\F_p)\text{,}\) a question that we leave open for now.</p>
