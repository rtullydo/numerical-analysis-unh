<p>In elementary or middle school, we learn how to solve algebraic equations. Equations that are algebraic can be solved with familiar operations: addition, multiplication, exponentiation. However, there are very simple equations that cannot be solved with algebra. Consider</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\cos x = x.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>There is no way to extract the \(x\) from inside the cosine to isolate it on one side of the equation. Even algebraic equations may be impossible to solve. Consider</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x^6 - x - 1 = 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>There is no formula that can be used to factor this equation (like the quadractic formula). If we're not fortunate enough to get a polynomial that has obvious “nice” factors, the only way to proceed is to approximate the solutions. Questions like this fall under the general category of <dfn class="terminology">root finding</dfn> problems. A root is a solution to the equation \(f(x) = 0\text{.}\)</p>
