<p>One way that we can try to make a better approximating polynomial for a function is to sample more points near the edge - this should allow us to control the bad behavior that seems to occur there. But how should we pick the points? For various reasons, it turns out that a natural choice for sampling nodes (that is, the \(x\)-values that we'll use to sample the function we're trying to approximate) is the so-called <dfn class="terminology">Chebyshev nodes</dfn>, which correspond to the \(x\) coordinates of equally spaced points on a unit circle.</p>
