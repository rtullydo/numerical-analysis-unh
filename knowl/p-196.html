<p>We can change the problem slightly. Imagine that from a pool of \(n\)objects, we select \(r\) of them and make arrangements. For example, I might want to know how many ways I can choose a class president, vice president, and secretary from a group of 30 students. One way of looking at this is in terms of choice: I have 30 possible choices for president, 29 for vice-president after I've selected the president, and 28 for the secretary. By the fundamental principle of counting, I have \(30 \cdot 29 \cdot 28\) possible choices. This is a perfectly valid way of counting permutations of a subset, but we're looking for something that can be generalized and not treated case by case. A simple computational trick (essentially cleverly unsimplifying a fraction) will let us write this in a more useful form:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
30 \cdot 29 \cdot 28 = \frac{30 \cdot 29 \cdot 28 \cdot (27 \cdot \ldots \cdot 1)}{(27 \cdot \ldots \cdot 1)} = \frac{30!}{27!} = \frac{30!}{(30 - 3)!}
\end{equation*}
