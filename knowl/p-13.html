<p>A plot shows that they cross. But where? You learned a long time ago to find intersections between two graphs by setting the functions equal:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2x = \cos x
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which really can be thought of as a root finding problem:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2x - \cos x = 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Can algebra solve this? The equation above is sometimes called a transcedental equation - that is, it involves functions that cannot be undone with the operations of algebra. Except in very special cases, there is no way to solve for \(x\text{.}\) And yet, we can see the intersection. To find it, we'll study a pile of techniques in an area called <dfn class="terminology">root finding</dfn>.</p>
