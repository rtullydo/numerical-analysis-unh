<p>You are probably familiar with the next concept, though perhaps have not ever seen it formalized. As a motivating example, suppose you are have three shirts to choose from and four pairs of pants. How many different outfits can you make? It should be clear that we have to multiply the number of options to get the correct answer of eight (each shirt could be combined with four different pairs of pants). That choices or options multiply is such a central fact of counting that we give it a name.</p>
