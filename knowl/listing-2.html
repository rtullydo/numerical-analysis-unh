#Numerical Analysis
#9/5/2019
#Ryan Tully-Doyle

#This set of examples will focus on loops and arrays, which are structures
#that we will be using constantly.
#A for loop runs over an index that goes through a prescribed set of numbers.
#The formatting is slightly different than other languages, but powerful
#in a mathematics context.

#the following loop will run for values of i starting at 1 and ending at 10.
#Each iteration will perform the same command.

for i = 1:10
  disp(i) #display the current value of i
end

#unlike other langauges, non-integer indicies can be used in octave/matlab.

for i = 1:.1:10 #starts at 1, counts by .1 until reaching 10
  disp(i) #display the current value of i
end

#it is useful to be able to exit a loop on a condition. in octave, this
#command is called break

for i=1:10
  disp(i)
  if i == 5
    printf("You have to stop now!\n") #\n tells printf to break the line
    break
  end
end

#Next, we'll look at how octave deals with arrays, or lists of numbers.
#Functions in octave by default can act on arrays or scalars without using loops

X = 12:17;
disp(X)

#you might wish to know how long an array is

length(X)

#you might like to know the largest element in an array

max(X)

#If you want to refer to a specific element in an array, you can extract it
#by invoking its index.

X(3) #calls the third entry of X

#You can take slices of arrays by using index ranges

X(3:5) #calls the third through fifth entry of X

#As octave is natively an array based language, vector operations are natural.
#arrays of the appropriate sizes can be added, subtracted and multiplied by scalars.

X=1:10;
Y = 2:11;
X + Y
Y - Y
2*X

#since mathematical functions are natively array functions, you can apply a function
#to an array.

sin(X)

#Every time you use an operation that might be ambiguous (things involving
#multiplication and subtraction, add a . to the operation to specify that you
#want the operation to be applied to each entry.
