<p>Unfortunately, this seems to have exacerbated the problem. The polynomial starts to oscillate wildly and to grow sharply between nodes near the outside of the domain.  It turns out that this behavior is common in high degree polynomial interpolation of equally-spaced points. Replacing a complicated function with a polynomial interpolant isn't going to be as easy as sampling equidistant points, and we should expect that similar bad behavior is going to crop up in data sets with many points if we use a unique polynomial fit.</p>
