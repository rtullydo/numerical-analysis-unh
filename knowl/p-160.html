<p>The theorem is quite a bit more powerful than stated here. The proof requires some sophisticated machinery from the area of functional analysis, and will be sketched in sometime in the future. The main issue is one of convergence - why should an infinite series for an \(L^2\) function converge? What conditions need to be present on the coefficients of such a series to make this happen? For now, we suppress this discussion as outside the scope of the current objective, which is to treat the Fourier series as a black box and discover a method for computing the coefficients.</p>
