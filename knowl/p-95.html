<p>Lagrange interpolation is easy to describe and relatively easy to write out by hand, even for many point, with some practice. However, the computation of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial doesn't easily lend itself to the structure of computer programs. We would like a method for writing down an interpolating polynomial that can be performed in a straightforward way in a recursive fashion. The approach that we present here is called <dfn class="terminology">Newton interpolation</dfn>. Of course, the result will be the same, as interpolating polynomials of degree \(n-1\) are unique for a given set of \(m\) points.</p>
