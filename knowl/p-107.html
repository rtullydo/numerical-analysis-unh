<p>Instead of trying to force a high degree polynomial to fit through many points, if we want an interpolating function that has smooth properties, we could consider a piecewise approach instead. That is, instead of a single formula that interpolates all of the points, we'll construct small segments that join together into a smooth(ish) function that changes definition as we move down the set of data points. Piecewise interpolation is usually done in early math classes with a ruler connecting points with lines - a more sophisticated name for this is linear interpolation. Because a given line only has two parameters (slope and intercept), the best we can expect is to meet two conditions - that is, the line passes through each of two points.</p>
